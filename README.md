# MAN DigitalHub Challenge

## Introduction

Hi CCE Team! üëã  

For this challenge, I followed your advice: *"Have fun and when in doubt, simplify!"*. I focused on a clean, serverless design using high-level AWS services and infrastructure-as-code, keeping the implementation straightforward while demonstrating automation, cloud-native best practices, and maintainable code.

## Project overview  

### Key Features:
- REST API for CRUD operations on vehicles (`POST /vehicle`, `GET /vehicles`, `DELETE /vehicle`). 
  - You can check the openapi spec in the project for these requests.  
- Persistence in DynamoDB (`vehicle-demo` table)  
- Weekly summary of vehicle count generated and stored in S3 (`vehicle-summary` bucket)  
- Fully automated deployment using AWS SAM  

### Tech Stack:
- AWS Lambda (Python 3.13)  
- DynamoDB  
- S3  
- API Gateway 
- AWS SAM / CloudFormation  
- Docker

## Architecture & Design  

### Architecture Explanation:
The system is fully serverless and event-driven. Client requests are sent through API Gateway, which routes them to the Vehicle Lambda for CRUD operations on DynamoDB. Separately, a scheduled Summary Lambda runs via EventBridge, counts the items in DynamoDB, and stores a summary file in S3. This separation keeps the API lightweight while ensuring reporting runs independently.

### Design Decisions:
- **Serverless:** Lambda functions for event-driven, scalable endpoints  
- **High-level AWS Services:** DynamoDB used instead of custom databases for simplicity and managed scalability  
- **Infrastructure-as-Code:** SAM chosen for reproducibility and ease of deployment  
- **Validation & Data Modeling:** `VehicleModel` ensures data integrity before persisting  
- **Decoupling:** Separate Lambda for weekly summary to reduce load on main API  

### Considerations:  
- Free Tier compatible  
- Schedule for summary can be adjusted (currently daily)  
- Error handling included for common DynamoDB conflicts (e.g., duplicate VIN)  

## Deployment  

### Requirements
- AWS account (also works on free tier version)
- Docker  
- Docker Compose (optional)  
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- AWS credentials configured (`~/.aws/credentials`)

###  Option 1: Using Docker Compose (optional)  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** For this lightweight, serverless solution, Docker Compose is a bit overkill, but I wanted to provide it as an option for convenience.  

```
docker compose up --build
```

Useful if you want a fully reproducible environment with minimal local setup, or if you plan to expand to multiple services in the future.

###  Option 2: Using Docker only (simpler)  
If you prefer to run with just Docker, these commands will work:  

```
docker build -t vehicle-demo-deployer .

docker run --rm -it \
  -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID \
  -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY \
  -e AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=eu-west-1 \
  -v ~/.aws:/root/.aws:ro \
  vehicle-demo-deployer
```

Quick and sufficient for this serverless project since all you need is the AWS SAM CLI inside a single container.

## High-level CI/CD Strategy

I noticed in your interview guideline that GitLab is the platform you use, which I know well. For this project, I replicated the level of automation I aim for in any stack, using Docker to manage the build environment and create the application image through the [Gitlab Container Registry](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/packages/container_registry/), while leveraging [GitLab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/) to automate the build and deployment process from start to finish.  

### Pipeline Flow:  

1. **Source Control:** Developer pushes code ‚Üí [GitLab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/) triggers pipeline  
2. **Linting & Unit Tests:** Python tests + code quality checks  
3. **Approval Gate:** Manual approval before production deploy  
4. **Build & Package:** SAM build and package commands  
5. **Deployment:** Deploy to environment  
6. **Monitoring:** CloudWatch logs and metrics (maybe with a Datadog integration for better monitoring)


## Wrap-up

Thanks for the fun challenge! I really enjoyed putting this together.  
I‚Äôm looking forward to chatting with you in the interview and hearing your thoughts. üôÇ
